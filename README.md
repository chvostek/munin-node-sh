# This is munin-node-sh
It's a munin-node alternative written entirely in shell, with minimal dependencies.

Munin-node-sh is not associated with or part of the Munin project.  Munin lives at http://munin-monitoring.org/.

## Note:

* For simplicity, munin-node-sh assumes that all servers and plugins are capable of [multipath](http://munin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugin/protocol-multigraph.html) and [dirtyconfig](http://munin.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugin/protocol-dirtyconfig.html).
